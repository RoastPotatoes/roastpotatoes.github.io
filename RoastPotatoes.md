This is a blog that is primarily about Mechanical Keyboards and various input devices. This occasionally includes trackballs when I can get them.

I try to focus on a variety of different keyboards including the stock and custom variety that is popular in the community.

The other major feature of this blog is Artisan/Artisanal keycaps. I try to cover as much about the Artisan keycaps that I am able to find every month. 

If you are interested in Mechanical Keyboards I suggest you visit:
