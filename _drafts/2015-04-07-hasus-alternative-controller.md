One of the first things I wanted to do when I got my HHKB was to customize the layout. This was mostly because I use colemak and to change the layout I had to do this software side on my computer. This was annoying as it meant having multiple configurations for all of my layouts. I also ran into problems with my window manager not working properly. Another problem this caused was that I already had a programmable keyboard (my ergodox) that was programmed to use colemak. This meant the computer had to be set to qwerty so the scancodes were interpreted as colemak. Since all my keyboards aren't programmable this caused problems. Even so I really want to be able to customise my keyboard layout.

Hasu provides a great solution to this problem. It really is the only solution that works well enough to use. You could of course have different keybinds set on your computer but this is not portable or at all ideal. The alternative controller is a simple replacement controller that can replace the existing controller inside of your HHKB. It also does not damage your existing controller, all you have to do is disconnect the cable and connect it to the new controller. This is good if you want to sell the keyboard as stock or if you (understandably) don't want to do any irreversible modification to your $235 keyboard.  
The way I see it it only enhances your experience with the keyboard. 
# How to Install
The installation process is very simple. As I stated earlier you don't damage the keyboard during the installation process.

You must first unscrew the back side of your case. There are three screws.

Then open the keyboard until you have access to the existing controller. You need to unscrew the controller before you can remove the cable.

Then unscrew your existing controller. This is only a single screw.

Then grasp the cable by its width so you are applying even pressure when you pull it out.

Then simply connect Hasu's controller. Remember do push it in evenly so you don't bend any pins.

Reassembling the keyboard can be a little bit tricky as you have to screw the controller in before you put the top part on.

Then carefully put the top of the case on. It is easy to not engage the front of the case. So ensure that the latches are engaged.

The last step is to screw back up the case. You are almost done accept you now have to program your keyboard.

# Compiling Firmware
The controller can easily use Hasu's own firmware TMK.
