## Brocaps
Quite excitingly Brocaps has been very active recently. Straight into April Brocaps introduced his new line of keycaps "Precision Gaming".
### Precision Gaming

The current release of keycaps are the "Topre Gamers Set". The current offering is: Esc row key, WASD keys and Fn keys. This of course draws similarities to the previously ongoing announcement of the previous [Topre Gamer Set](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=60081.0). However one difference is the Esc row key.   
I think this announcement is more representitive of what he may be offering and the previous thread was just more of a showcase. However these keycaps are looking incredibly nice. Brocaps standards are impeccable and these are some stunning looking keycaps. The texture on them looks amazing and the colour is very deep and almost entrancing. These are certainly holding a high standard for artisan keycaps.
It is fair to say that the reception has been great for these keycaps. But this is a common theme with Brocaps. 
### Easter Keycaps

Sadly this was only a tease. The keycaps shown were pastel coloured Topre in Esc row, WASD and Fn. There are both textured caps which I believe to be the gamer keycaps as well as Brobots v2 for the Esc row. This may have just been a tease however they are eerily similar to the recently announced "Topre Gamer Set" so perhaps these will be sold with the gamer set, as a run over sale or as the special higher ticket caps.
## KatzenKinder

Had a 4.0 sale. The sale included:

* 8 x Topre blanks
* 6 x MX blanks
* 9 x MX Axols
* 6 x MX Beardboys

I think KatzenKinder is a great keycap maker and I really like the colour combinations used in most of their keycaps. The Axol design is also a very nice signature keycap.
