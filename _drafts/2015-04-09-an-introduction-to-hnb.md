I was first introduced to hnb while browsing unixporn. And saw it as an interesting program that seemed like a simple but elegant solution to keeping track of tasks and visualising that information. After I saw it I felt compelled to use it. But I did not really use it for a while. I took me a while before I really got to using it. This is because I misunderstood the fundementals of using it.
## What is hnb?
hnb is a program that allows you to store data in a hierarchal order. It is a simple ncurses program so has a very 'minimal' interface. Being drawn in ncurse is not however a detriment. The strengths of hnb are its simplicity. All you need to see is the text. And this is done perfectly.
