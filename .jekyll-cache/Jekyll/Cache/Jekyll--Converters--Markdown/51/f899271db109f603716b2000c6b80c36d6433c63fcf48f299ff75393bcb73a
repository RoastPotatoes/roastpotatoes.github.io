<p><img src="https://imgur.com/umFEuSYh.jpg" alt="POK3R keyboard sleeve" /></p>

<p>I saw these a little bit of a while ago but did not remember their name. But I did remember them as they have a very distinctive look about them. The awesome looking business card and packaging also attributes to a aesthetic.</p>

<p>At $35 + shipping these are quite reasonable.<br />
Custom orders are also available.</p>

<em>Possible Box art</em></p>

<p>This was something else that struck me as incredibly exciting. These new pictures are further proof that this project is indeed more than hot air. The image above is the potential box art.</p>

<p>The other images are photos of almost fully assembled prototypes. At the bottom is a link to all the photos. Also, pictured is the custom styrofoam case.

<h2 id="jd45">JD45</h2>
<p>This project has been around for a while and it could be closer to a wider GB. You might have guessed from the name, but the JD45 is similar to the JD40 but has 5 more switches. JDCarpe does know what he’s doing so it is of solid design.</p>

<p>The indication of movement is the twitter photo of an aluminium (probably) milled case.</p>

<h2 id="hunger-works-studio-ynth">Hunger Works Studio :~$ynth</h2>
<p>This was probably the most exciting new project as I was not at all aware of something like this happening.</p>

<p>This is the :~$ynth 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Sxv5LSF.jpg" alt=":~$ynth " /></p>

<p>It is the underside of a keycap mould that makes keycap making a bit easier. If you are interested in making your own keycaps, I suggest you read the whole thread.</p>

<p>This video featuring binge is also tells you what you need to know.</p>

<h2 id="max-falcon-8">Max Falcon-8</h2>
<p>This is an 8 key keyboard. Make of it what you will. It could be a media pad, WASD or whatever use you have for it. <br />
You are given a large amount of customisation options on the maxkeyboards website so this is a bit of a unique product.</p>

<p>Every time Granite ends it immediately becomes in demand again. This is R4 the most likely final round.<br />
Already it has proved to be very popular with 4310 kits purchased.</p>

<h2 id="enjoypbt-gb">EnjoyPBT GB</h2>
<p>This is a really awesome GB as it’s run by Shadowvved and they look to be excellent keycaps. Shadovved is a good name to be attached to a GB and you are likely to be very safe with this one. I have seen EnjoyPBT’s name continue to crop up over the past weeks but they did not see to be too freely available.</p>

<p>I absolutely love the CMYKRGB kits although they are printed.</p>

<p>Everything is a little more expensive than the previous Gateron GB caps but they do look to be of nice quality.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dyesubs $75</li>
  <li>Blanks
    <ul>
      <li>Single Tone $35</li>
      <li>Dual Tone $40</li>

<h2 id="cooler-master-masterkeys-pro-lpro-s">Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro L/Pro S</h2>
<p>L = Fullsize
S = Tenkeyless</p>

<p>This is an RGB keyboard. I am sort of seeing a peak in RGB keyboards. If this good quality, I think it could at least fill the need for RGB keyboards.</p>

<p>It seems PMK is back to normal, and you are able to vote on new keyset designs. It still isn’t the most responsive or fluid design. But as of now it seems to be doing something.</p>
