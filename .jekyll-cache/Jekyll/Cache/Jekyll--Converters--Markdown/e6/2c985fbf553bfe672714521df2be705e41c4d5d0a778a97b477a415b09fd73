I"<p>I never thought I’d see the day but here we are.  A new set of HHKB keyboards.
Announced on the 9th of December (and I’ve only now seen the announcement!.</p>

<p>There are 3 new keyboards.</p>

<p>HHKB Classic
USB-C only</p>

<p>HHKB Hybrid
Bluetooth and USB-C
Reprogrammable</p>

<p>HHKB Hybrid Type-S
Bluetooth and USB-C
Reprogrammable
Upgraded silencing</p>

<p>Now it’s nothing entirely groundbreaking. Design wise, they’ve rounded the corners and removed the branding on the bottom row.
For the classic model the only real change is the migration to usb-c. Sadly it is not reprogrammable and only has dip switches like previous models.</p>

<p>The Hybrid models are more interesting as they have bluetooth, usb-c and are reprogrammable.</p>

<p>For customising keymaps, PFU have created their own little tool (HHKBKeymapTool_100.exe), which is only available for windows. Try as I might I could not get this to work in wine so I have no idea what it looks like or the complexity of the keymaps.</p>

<p>Eventually I span up a virtual machine to test it out. And unfortunately you can’t do anything without one of the new models plugged in. So i have no idea of it’s capabilities.</p>
