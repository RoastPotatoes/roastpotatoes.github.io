<h2 class="lazy" data-src="" id="an-improvement-on-the-model-m">An improvement on the Model M?</h2>
<p>Model Ms use membrane buckling springs whereas the Model Fs use capacative buckling springs.
What does this actually mean?
The capacitive switches sit on a pcb unlike the Model M which sit upon a plastic membrane.
This translates to a higher rating of keypresses. The metrics thrown around for old Model Fs are 100 million to the Model Ms 35 million. It’s unlikely you’d see the switches fail.</p>

<p>The main difference is in the <em>feel</em>. There’s a bit more tactitily and feedback to a keypress.</p>

<p>The other benefit is the capacative switches aren’t held togethew with plastic rivets like the Model Ms. So they won’t require a <a href="/2015/04/28/ibm-ssk-screw-mod-guide/">bolt/screw mod.</a> and won’t slowly disintegrate under your fingers.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-a-limited-opportunity">This is a limited opportunity*</h2>
<p>Never before has there been a project that has completely from the ground, up re-made a historical keyboard and made it to production. There will be this initial production run and a final kickstarter tbc.</p>

<h2 id="theyre-solid-and-future-proof">They’re solid and future-proof:</h2>
<p>Made of die cast zinc and clocking in at 3.4 kg (for F62 and 3.8 kg for the F77) it’s safe to say this is one mother of a keyboard. You’d be hard pressed to find another keyboard that weighs as much and has this kind of sturdy construction.</p>

<h2 id="programable">Programable</h2>
<p>If you were to pick up an old unit today, it would likely require some maintenance and a signal converter to get it working.
These come with a USB cable and are fully programmable from the get go.</p>

<h2 id="theyre-so-damn-sexy">They’re so damn sexy</h2>
<p>A very subjective point but both the F66 and F77 look stunning. No frills, RGB or otherwise, just industrial beauty.</p>

<p><strong>The Model F reconnaissance is coming.</strong></p>

<p>It’s taken over 4 years for this project to get where it is today, but it’s completely blown away that it’s actually happened.</p>

<p>I can’t decide whether to get a F62 or F77…</p>
