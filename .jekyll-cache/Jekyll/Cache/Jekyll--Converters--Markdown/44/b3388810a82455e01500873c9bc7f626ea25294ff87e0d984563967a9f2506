I"Ø<p>When I was hand wiring my planck, I could not really find a guide that I really liked. I really managed to get through building it by looking at as many photos of planck builds as possible. I hope this guide reduces the need somewhat. It is a great mechanical keyboard so I wanted at least a semi-comprehensive guide.</p>

<p>The hand wired planck is being phased out. But if you really want to do it, this is still a viable option.</p>

<p>This is a slight rehash of <a href="http://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/brownfox-step-by-step-t6050.html">Matt3oâ€™s BrownFox</a> guide, but I made some graphics to hopefully clarify a few things.</p>

<h2 id="switches">Switches</h2>
<p>This is the diagram I am using for a switch. This is the underside so it is sort of reversed but donâ€™t over think it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/planck-hand-wire-guide/switch-explanation-diagram.png" alt="switch underside diagram" /></p>

<p>The first thing you will want to do is put all your switches in your plate.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/planck-hand-wire-guide/switches-in-plate.png" alt="switches in planck plate" />
<em>Reverse view.</em></p>

<p>The best way to start off is to put some solder on both of the switch pins. This makes it easier down the line when you have to put on small wires.</p>

<h2 id="diodes">Diodes</h2>

<p>Next you need to put on your diodes. I found this was somewhat easy to do but I sometimes just did one at a time.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/planck-hand-wire-guide/diode-bending-diagram.png" alt="diode placement" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Place your diode in between the first pin and the leg. You will find the best way to do this with a little practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bend it round so it is facing straight down.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can either solder before step 3 or after. But you just want to heat the connecting pin as it has solder you applied earlier. Then  bend it round like in part 3.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You should have something that looks like this when you have done all of them.
<img src="/assets/planck-hand-wire-guide/diodes-in-matrixish.png" alt="diodes put in matrix" /></p>

<p>To fully complete the diode rows you will have to solder both point A and B. If you did point A earlier then you have done this and there is no need to do it again.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/planck-hand-wire-guide/diode-soldering-positions.png" alt="where to solder for rows" /></p>

<h2 id="wiring-columns">Wiring Columns</h2>
<p>The next part is probably the worst. This is because it requires preparing the wire which can be quite fiddly if you donâ€™t have any wire cutting tools.</p>

<p>The best way to do this is to measure your wire against your planck. You want to create something like this (but vertical). You want to keep as much of the wireâ€™s insulation as possible as it can be quite hectic in a hand wired board.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/planck-hand-wire-guide/wire-look.png" alt="How column wires should look" /></p>

<p>I found that if you get a piece of paper and mark out the positions you can easily use this for a template. You will be making 12 of these so a template is appreciated.</p>

<p>To cut the wire pieces in the centre I used a razor blade to make two cuts whilst rotating the wire to cut it all around. Then all you have to do is cut downwards so that you go through the two cuts and you can take off that section.</p>

<p>You then need to solder them on to the switches like this.

<h2 id="wiring-to-the-teensy">Wiring to the Teensy</h2>
<p>I found this stage the most complicated as I could not find the matrix generator. So these positions are for the default firmware on github.</p>

<p>At this point you are soldering both the columns and rows. The columns are on the pin of the switch and the rows are on the diode end as shown in the below diagram.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/planck-hand-wire-guide/soldering-directions-row-column.png" alt="Where you need to solder rows and columns on the planck" /></p>

<p>The numbers here are corresponding to the pins on the teensy. F1 is column zero and ascending to D7 is column 11. D0 is row 0 ascending to row 3 at B6.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/planck-hand-wire-guide/matrix-with-wires-and-numbering.png" alt="matrix with column and row labels" /></p>

<p>I have my teensy positioned up, in-between row D5 and B5. I suggest putting a bit of electrical tape above and below to reduce any shorts.</p>

<p>You will then need to flash the firmware which you can find here. <a href="https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboard/planck">Github planck firmware.</a></p>

<p><a href="/2015/03/22/ergodox/">I wrote a guide on flashing the ergodox firmware which is fairly similar if you are stuck.</a></p>

<p>One issue I had was flashing the hex use this command if the recommended commands are not working. This requires teensy-cli on linux systems.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>teensy-loader-cli -mmcu=atmega32u4 -w -v "name of your generated hex here"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It took a long time to get it to a usable state. You may notice some additional wire here and there were things broke. But this should be assembled as per my instructions.
