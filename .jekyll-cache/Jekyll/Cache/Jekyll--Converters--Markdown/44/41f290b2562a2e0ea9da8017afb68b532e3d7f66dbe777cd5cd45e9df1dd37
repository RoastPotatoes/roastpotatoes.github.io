I thought this set was worth mentioning as I felt it did catch my eye differently when I saw it compared to many others sets I see.<br />
These are going to be available by thee end of the month on <a href="http://www.geekkeys.com/">geekkeys.com</a>. This news after all does come from feng the owner of geekkeys.</p>

<p>They are dyesub PBT and come with an equally interesting keycap stand.</p>

<h2 id="aluminium-hhkb-disappointment">Aluminium HHKB Disappointment</h2>
<p>With the announcement of a aluminium HHKB case people were not too excited. This was for good reason. It was very boxy not particularly appealing and possibly not what the HHKB owners were looking for. geekhack community member CPTBadAss is currently in possesion of the case for testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=76746.0">Read what CPTBadAss first impressions of it.</a></p>

<p>To sum it up this quote from CPTBadAss works well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So as some of the community is aware, Massdrop came out with a metal HHKB case. I asked to review it because I was just curious and I was willing to put aside my Topre bias to try it out. I had planned to write a review but unfortunately, the case isnâ€™t ready for market. The design isnâ€™t complete right now and I believe that at best, itâ€™s a proof of concept and MD ran an IC. Because the case isnâ€™t at final, market ready condition, I wonâ€™t be writing a full review.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>livingspeedbump of keychatter is next in line to get the case so more opinion should be available soon.</p>

<p>If however you remain undiscouraged, it is the <a href="http://world.taobao.com/item/523139210844.htm?fromSite=main&amp;spm=a1z10.5-c.w4002-3510863721.27.13jLVo">HHKB aluminium case is now available on taobao</a></p>

<p>With the release of Fallout 4 this is particularly relevant. It has been a long time in planning and ran into legal issues with use of some copyrighted images but the final designs have been finalized. The two designs are available in SA ROW 1, SA ROW 3 and DSA.</p>

<p>As, I will probably have some of these soon. I would just like to get them out there a bit more. I am getting some A3 prints. Price yet to be determined.</p>

This is a new custom keyboard kit based on the cherry 1800 layout. It is an affordable custom with a nice amount of options.</p>

<p>I think this layout always looks fantastic, but it is not what I prefer for use.</p>

<p>You would be looking at a 140 USD price for the basic model but the alu skin set will be more expensive around 245.</p>

<p>I thought it was worth another mention as it is getting closer to fruition. I am writing a bit about it in another post including small Ellipse interview. But if you were not in the know. It is a recreation of the very popular and rare kishsaver F62 and F77 Model F buckling spring keyboard. With prototypes hopefully getting here in the next few weeks this could be possible quite soon.</p>

<p>This is a very rare GB and is the first of its kind at this scale.</p>
