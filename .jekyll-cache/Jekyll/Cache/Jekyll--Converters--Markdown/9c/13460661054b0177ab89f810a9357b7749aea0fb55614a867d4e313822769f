<p>I give an on and off mention of this, as it could be coming at any time. If you aren’t clued in this, it is an impending artisan keycap sale by punksdead.</p>

<h2 id="jukebox-sa-back-on-massdrop">Jukebox SA Back on Massdrop</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/13UXzhF.jpg" alt="JukeBox Keycap Keyset" />
The popular keyset designed by Andy of <a href="https://keychatter.com/">Keychatter</a> is back.
This is a great looking keyset but the drawback this time is the production time. Signature Plastics is continually developing their backlog as popularity rises. The aimed ship date of these is November the 7th. You may also have noticed that the 1976 keyset production has also run into delays.</p>

Leftover parts from the OLKB massdrop are now for sale on the OLKB store. The store has switched over from magento to squarespace, and I must say it is looking really nice.</p>

<p>I am highly fond of Ortholinear Keyboards and I recommend them wholeheartedly.</p>

<h2 id="the-pio-one">The Pio One</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JYHD6EI.png" alt="The Pio One Prototype" />
The Pio One is a keyboard very similar to the Optimus Keyboard. If you don’t know what one of those is, the idea is a screen behind every switch. Giving you complete control over what is under each transparent keycap.</p>

<p>This is obviously quite expensive and means they are not mechanical switches, or at least mechanical switches as we would commonly refer to.</p>

<p>This will be a kickstarter idea, and I’m sure it will be very expensive. The real issue will be getting a price people feel this feature is worth.</p>

<em>First Box Contents</em><br />
Lucid Cases it the Loot Crate esque keyboard subscription box. I don’t really like the model, but if people like what they get then I can’t complain.</p>

<p>They are currently running a promotion to win a K-Type the new Tenkeyless from Input Club. I believe all you have to do is get in on the May box.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/J0bjCCI.jpg" alt="New Buckling Spring Switch Prototype with Blue Keycap" />
I’ve got to keep mentioning it as it will really be an uphill battle to get this funded.</p>

<p>The product on offer is a single unit buckling spring switch. This differs from the actual buckling spring which is not available in individual switch modules. Having the possibility of creating new buckling spring keyboards in the future is what makes this an exciting kickstarter.</p>

<p>I have been giving Wooting a lot of attention lately, but that is because they are putting out so much good content.</p>

<p>This latest blog post details the factory experience of the Wooting One. It comes with some interesting videos detailing keyboard construction. Watching keycaps being lasered is always fun to watch.</p>

<p>Find all the videos on the Wooting Blog.</p>
