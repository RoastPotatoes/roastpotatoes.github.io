I have to say these are pretty spot on. The sculpting all looks really clean and awesome. The castle in particular has a very nice looking texture and the turtle shells have some very nice colours.</p>

<p>I would be interested in getting some of these. And on the 13th of February you have a chance. As, that is when a giveaway is taking place.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m pretty jazzed on these. Not only are there some excellent sculpted caps there are also some nice looking blanks.</p>

A new maker has appeared with an aluminium milled keycap. The design is quite something and they also come in some snazzy vacuum packed packaging.</p>

This is the new name for the maker who created the reactor keycap. Itâ€™s a bit pricey but it is a unique keycap. You can currently purchase the reactor cap alongside some other backlit keycaps on massdrop.</p>

<h2 id="tp4">Tp4</h2>
<p>This was a nice surprise as I was not expecting tp to be involved in any keycap production but here we are. The design is in the image of the Gurren Lagann drill. Iâ€™m fairly certain itâ€™s a keycap but there are still no photos of the underside.</p>

<h2 id="suited-up-by-bambino">Suited Up by Bambino</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/45zzGN3.jpg" alt="keybuto" />
Bambino has started off very strong with three designs, the keybuto, Duke and Spartan. The duke is the standout with some excellent colour use.

R.A.G. Caps is still going strong and even with some successful spacebar casts. My new favourite would be the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/l2UiHDQ.jpg">celtic.</a></p>

The Polar Ice Sale happened incredibly quickly but featured some very nice keycaps, as you have guessed it was an icy theme.  <br />
Sadly there are none left but you can browse what you missed out on the <a href="http://techkeys.us/collections/artisan">techkeys.us</a> store.</p>

A sale been and gone but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tinymonkeyt/">/u/TINYMONKEYT</a> has been seen before with <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bDJELGq.jpg">these designs</a>.</p>

<p>I like the snow peaked mountain but it might benefit from a smoother texture which is often hard to get right.</p>

<h2 id="gloyz">Gloyz</h2>
<p>Gloyz have been continuing to make their creature keycaps and a couple are still left. The use of multiple colours is very skilful and there are some very intricately designed creatures.</p>

Keypress graphics is known for painting keycaps. And I do think some nice things have been created.</p>

<p>A lot of keycaps are currently available on the Keypress Graphics website.</p>

Not the most complicated of design but I do think the simpler keycaps can be quite striking. I like the character and think this is a good start.</p>

<p>The Jolly Rodger a new pirate keycap was shown with the date 2/15/2016 attached. Whether that is still happening or not Iâ€™m not sure. I canâ€™t seem to find that image.</p>

<p><a href="https://ctrlalt.io/bro-caps/tr8-0r">There was also a TR8-0R sale featuring a stormtrooper coloured reaper.</a></p>

<p>I would also guess a good sized sale might be coming soon.</p>
