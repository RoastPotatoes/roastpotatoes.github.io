I"í<p>I never thought Iâ€™d see the day but here we are.  A new set of HHKB keyboards.
Announced on the 9th of December (and Iâ€™ve only now seen the announcement!.</p>

<p>There are 3 new keyboards.</p>

<p>HHKB Classic:
HHKB Pro 2 but with USB-C and no usb ports!</p>

<p>HHKB Hybrid:
Bluetooth and USB-C
Reprogrammable</p>

<p>HHKB Hybrid Type-S:
Bluetooth and USB-C
Reprogrammable
Upgraded silencing</p>

<p>Now itâ€™s nothing entirely groundbreaking. Design wise, theyâ€™ve rounded the corners and removed the branding on the bottom row.
For the classic model the only real change is the migration to usb-c. Sadly it is not reprogrammable and only has dip switches like previous models.</p>

<p>The Hybrid models are more interesting as they have bluetooth, usb-c and are reprogrammable.</p>

<p>For customising keymaps, PFU have created their own little tool (<a href="https://happyhackingkb.com/download/">HHKBKeymapTool_100.exe</a>), which is only available for windows. Try as I might I could not get this to work in wine so I wasted a few hours on that.
Eventually I span up a virtual machine to test it out. And unfortunately you canâ€™t do anything without one of the new models plugged in. So I have no idea of itâ€™s capabilities.</p>

<p>So apologies this is the best I managed to get.
