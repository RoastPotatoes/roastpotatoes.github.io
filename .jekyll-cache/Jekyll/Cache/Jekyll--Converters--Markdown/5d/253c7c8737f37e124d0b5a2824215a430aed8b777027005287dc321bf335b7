<p>The eagerly awaited project is nearly complete. You are currently able to order an F62 or F77 in this early round. This early round is running until 2/29/2016 and aiming to ship April/May time. This is not your only chance as a later round will run from 3/1/2016 through 6/30/2016 and shipping August/September.</p>

<p>There is no price difference between ordering in the early or later round. But these will likely be the only opportunities to order one.</p>

<p>They are available to purchase through <a href="https://www.modelfkeyboards.com/shop/">https://www.modelfkeyboards.com/shop/</a></p>

<h2 id="buckling-spring-reimagining">Buckling Spring Reimagining</h2>
<p>I couldnâ€™t quite think what to call this but the premise is buckling springs in a single unit. A switch much like the cherry design but containing all the parts that make buckling springs the switch they are.</p>

<p>This did seem to come out of nowhere and it is an excellent project that could bring some very interesting possibilities.</p>

<p>As a new switch this is an excellent idea but I have no idea how it could feel and if it replicates the buckling spring feel.</p>

<p>The project seems to be fairly close to coming to fruition and with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/43geg7/lets_get_custom_buckling_spring_keyboards_i_want/czju2kl">patent pending</a> we could see this somewhere soon.</p>

<h2 id="pulse-and-flatline">PuLSE and Flatline.</h2>
<p>The popular keyset is back in two forms or almost back.</p>

<p>PuLSE run by Mito is back on massdrop. Previously being never run again, now running again!</p>

<p>If you are interested in some drama and other matters relating to ownership of colourways <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=78797.250">this thread is what you are looking for.</a></p>

What is more interesting is what happened in fallout from the debacle. Fulse (it went through a couple of names) now Flatline was created. A colourway reminiscent of the Pulse arrangement. Although, this is good because there was demand for a set like this. But the real reason this is important is the information it may have brought to light. And this is the new pricing structure for community GBâ€™s from Signature Plastics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>25 sets                   $237.61 per set<br />
50 sets                   $171.32 per set<br />
75 sets                   $149.23 per set<br />
100 sets                 $138.18 per set<br />
150 sets                 $127.13 per set<br />
200 sets                 $121.61 per set<br />
250 sets                 $118.29 per set</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you look at the currently run PuLSE keyset on massdrop, you will see the difference in pricing.</p>

<h2 id="division-zero-by-daskeyboard">Division Zero by daskeyboard</h2>
<p>This is the introduction of a new brand of gaming peripherals as well as some new switches.</p>

<p>Two new switches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alpha-Zulu Tactile</li>
  <li>Alpha-Zulu Linear</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.divisionzerogaming.com/switches/">Both of these are 45g actuation.</a></p>

<p>The X40 Keyboard
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RjEmPKj.png" alt="X40 daskeyboard keyboard" />
Looks very much like a gaming keyboard. Unlike the regular daskeyboard this design involves more fins around the edges as well as a set of macro keys on the right-hand side.</p>
