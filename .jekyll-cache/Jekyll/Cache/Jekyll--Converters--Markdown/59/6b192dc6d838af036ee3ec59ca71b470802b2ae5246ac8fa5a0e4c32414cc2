The 62/60 is the 60%, hotswappable, custom RGB. It all looks pretty good, and the initial test round 0 has completed. Round 1 is likely to follow soon.</p>

<h2 id="whitefox-delayed">WhiteFox Delayed</h2>
<p>The WhiteFox has been delayed due to issues in plate production. Plates should be completed and shipped to massdrop by the end of June.<br />
This will obviously be disappointing to some, but it isn’t that uncommon. Massdrop looks a lot more professional than many groupbuys but always runs in to the same kind of issues. It might be taking longer than expected but it the orders will be fulfilled.</p>

<p>These switches were leaked last week and they are everything that they were expected to be. They are currently available on the Corsair K70. It’s RGB fullsize and £169.99. That price is horrendous and I think there are much better options available.</p>

<p>The new speed switches are not that much of a draw.</p>

<p>A quote from zeal:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Do you like dampening the up stroke and down stroke sound without affecting the feel much?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you wish stabilizers were transparent clear like Zealios?…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s all I can way for now.

</blockquote>

<p>So… a dampening method, and some stabilisers? Could be exciting.</p>

<p>Apparently this has been in the works for longer than I realised. <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=78155.0">More information.</a></p>

So I managed to completely miss this before, but the extremely popular korean custom, is coming to massdrop. This is both good and bad. It makes it widely available, which I can’t see any complaints about, but it is massdrop. Massdrop have had issues in the past, but I don’t think they have ever completely failed. If they are packed correctly then this would solve a common concern people have. But I wouldn’t imagine any shipping price decreases or anything like that.</p>
