From that title this is quite the keyboard. A community made hotswappable keyboard alone, has been rare enough to come by. But this is has RGB LED capability.</p>

<p>I am assuming the people or person behind this keyboard are Remainder Keyboards as that is what is on the PCB.</p>

<h3 id="copied-faq">Copied FAQ</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How can I get this?</strong><br />
More info + case pics will be coming next week! Round 0 (~15 boards) will occur in the next couple of weeks; I’ll gauge interest after that. If you’re interested in reviewing the board, send me a PM.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How does the lighting work?</strong><br />
There are a total of 72 RGB LEDs on the board- one per key on the front, and ten on the back. They are extremely easy to program- just set the RGB values in the firmware. (I’m currently implementing visual support into <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51252.0">EasyAVR</a>.) If you have programming experience, more complex effects are easy to implement.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How does hot-swapping work?</strong><br />
The board uses tech similar to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/2ksjjj/howto_sip_socket_mod/">SIP sockets</a>. All MX-compatible switches work, although translucent switches (Gaterons/Zealios) are recommended for best usage of the LEDs. The sockets used are <strong>not</strong> compatible with any other PCB on the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What 60% cases is it compatible with?</strong><br />
The screw holes on the current Round 0 batch are not in the correct, standard position; this will be corrected in future revisions, although with LEDs and pins on the back, it might not be compatible with most current cases. I’ll be offering my own acrylic sandwich cases- pics to come next week.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Is this plate or PCB mount?</strong><br />
It can be either! A plate makes it slightly more difficult to remove and insert switches, but provides more stability. More details on that will come with the case update.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How much will it cost?</strong><br />
Still working out pricing, but it’ll be around $120 for PCB + case (with integrated plate), fully assembled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Potentially priced at $120 (case and pcb).<br />
With all of that information I would certainly say this is an interesting project and the beginning of the new wave of RGB customs. It seems solid, I can only say wait and see how it turns out.</p>

I’m not sure if there has been much more development on the K-Type or if there is anything necessary to announce. But they now have official forum posts on <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=80894.0">geekhack</a>, <a href="https://deskthority.net/keyboards-f2/k-type-mechanical-keyboard-input-club-t13416.html#p297751">deskthority</a> and <a href="https://redd.it/4cgje9">reddit</a>.<br />
Last week they also created a page on idea hunt. I’m not familiar with this website, but the name is fairly self explanatory. You are able to propose ideas and people feedback on those ideas.</p>

<p>The frost Flake is a custom controller for the Cooler Master QFR. I always thought these were a good idea especially when I was getting into keyboards. It is a good way that you can make a programmable keyboard. But if you have this already as your keyboard then it is a good introduction to what else you could do with your keyboard.</p>

<h2 id="socal-meetup-in-1-week">SoCal Meetup in 1 Week</h2>
<p>This meetup isn’t for me but for anyone in Southern California try not to miss it. There are always posts after events like “how did I miss this?” or “how did I now know about this?” despite there being a sticky on /r/mk for weeks in advance.<br />
So hopefully this notifies somebody about the event they might have missed.</p>
