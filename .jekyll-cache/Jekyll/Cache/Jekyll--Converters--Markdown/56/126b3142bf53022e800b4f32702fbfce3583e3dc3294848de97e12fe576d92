I"ÿ<p>Around an hour ago it was announced that there would be a Bingecap sale. It is taking place on Thursday at <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20150416T19&amp;p0=64&amp;msg=Bingecap+Sale&amp;utm_source=getresponse&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=techkeys&amp;utm_content=BingeCap+Sale+-+Coming+Soon">7:00 CST</a>. Not much is known about the current offering but it is being hosted by <a href="https://techkeys.us/">TechKeys</a>. With this announcement there was also the announcement of an unknown item. But it is an item that was created in collaboration between Bingecaps and TechKeys. All purchases of Bingecaps will also ship with a free vinyl sticker.</p>

<p>I will update the post with more information as it is available.</p>
