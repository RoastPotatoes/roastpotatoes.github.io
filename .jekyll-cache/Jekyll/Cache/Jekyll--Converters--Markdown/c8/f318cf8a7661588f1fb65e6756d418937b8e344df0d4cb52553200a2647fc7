<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8QrPo1e.png" alt="Cherry GMK Keycap GB" />
This is a groupbuy for the recently available cherry GMK keys, In the above colours. This was around last week but as it is a rolling groupbuy it is still worth a mention.</p>

<p>It will be run until 150 sets have been ordered. At the time of writing this 102 have been ordered. Also, note that this set was previously for 6 keys however due to the popularity an additional keycap was added.</p>

<p>Prices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$16/set (and paypal fees)</li>
</ul>

<p>Shipping:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$10 (could be more if you are ordering a large amount.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This could be the new GMK spacebar, certainly something nice to collect.</p>

Run in a small GB on GH these are once again available on Massdrop. Pictured above is the reactor keycap but others are available. But I would say this is the more unique and interesting keycap on offer.<br />
Prices vary but you are looking at $55+shipping for a reactor.</p>

<p>A lot of new information in the GH thread, best of all a nice new video. The information is really on the parts so I don’t really want to regurgitate it, so if this interests you head to the thread.</p>

<h2 id="artisan-keycap-directory">Artisan Keycap Directory</h2>
<p>This was something I have been thinking of doing and I have something but this is really all I wanted to do, done by someone else.<br />
That person is Bambino, and it is really good list showcasing the creations of makers in the community.</p>

<p>I might still create my own but I’m not sure of its worth.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions or know of anyone not on the list please post in the thread.</p>

<p>On that note I am aiming for an artisan roundup by the end of this week.</p>
