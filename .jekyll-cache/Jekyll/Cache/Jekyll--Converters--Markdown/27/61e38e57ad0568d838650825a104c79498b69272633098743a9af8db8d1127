I"“<p>Not a huge amount of much this week.</p>

<h2 id="backlit-pok3r-on-massdrop">Backlit POK3R on Massdrop</h2>
<p>For those who want a backlit 60% this is a good option. The standard POK3R has been around for a while and has been quite well received. In general this is thought of as quite a nice stock 60%.</p>

<p>This is not a major setback or anything. But at this stage everyone is patiently waiting for the full prototype so delays like this can be the most frustrating. Prototypes could be still a week or so away.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s happening. <a href="https://blog.roastpotatoes.co/">blog.roastpotatoes.co</a> All previous links should still work. Potentially this opens up the possibility of store.roastpotatoes.co</p>

<p>I also managed to miss my deadline of Friday newsletter. It will happen this week.</p>

My posters were going excellent up until today when I really looked at them. They are OK, but maybe not where I had quite hoped the quality would be. Reprint is coming on Thursday so they are slightly delayed. I will see what happens from there.</p>

<p>Designs for 4704 keyboards have moved along quite a bit and I am quite interested to see what I will settle with. I have designs wish legends and without and the relegendeble keycaps.
