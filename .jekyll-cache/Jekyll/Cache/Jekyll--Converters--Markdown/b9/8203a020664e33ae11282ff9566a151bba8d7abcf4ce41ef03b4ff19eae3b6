<p>This is probably the biggest news but also not particularly interesting or at all what people wanted. I am not excited by this, but I’m sure there are some people who must find this new switch to be exactly what they wanted. But I would think this to be a rather small group.</p>

<p>These are RGB switches with 55cN weight.</p>

<p>This is another show of quiet innovation from blahlicus that I like. Whoever they are, they always seem to be making an interesting keyboard.</p>

<p>It’s a split version of the terminus Mini which can be seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/2w4fw7/the_terminus_mini_is_finally_completed_a_40_diy/">here.</a></p>

<p>More information is to be released as it happens. But currently it looks like it joins similar to the ergodox with a trrs cable in between. A wireless version could be possible in the future, but this is the first iteration.</p>

<p>With the absence of board makers last week Jack was working on the bluetooth planck. This allows you to somewhat easily add bluetooth functionality to your planck PCB.</p>

<h3 id="updates-on-tk78-60-with-numpad">Updates on TK78 60% with Numpad</h3>
<p>A revision of the PCB has been ordered for testing and they are hoping for a Christmas or new years ship date. This is an unusual design of a 60% with a numpad. I think this is something that there is a market for and I only hope this fills peoples needs.</p>

<h3 id="unnamed-60">Unnamed 60%</h3>
<p>The update also came with the announcement of a 60% keyboard kit that is launching on massdrop in time for Christmas. If it is affordably priced I can see this as a nice 60% for people to build. But currently there does not seem to be a lack of 60%’s.</p>
