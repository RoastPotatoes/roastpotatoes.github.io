Dodgy has been around for a while I only wish they were a little more active. They have quite a unique two piece construction and an excellent stamp on the back.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Yw2txkj.jpg" alt="Dodgy artisan cap" />
There was a new design in January which I was quite a fan of but no sales to speak of. I‚Äôm sure there will be more in the future but it is a shame some makers are so rare in their appearances.</p>

<h2 id="clack">Clack</h2>
<p>It has most definitely been confirmed that clack is or has least been back for the past month. This month has brought us clackvent. Where each day has brought a lucky person a keycap, I am not one of those but there is still hope for the future.</p>

<p>How clackvent works is you follow the thread like a hawk and await the daily instructions on how you can attain a keycap. This is often a simple task but the volume of people doing it means it is infinitely harder to getting the single cap.</p>

<h2 id="retro">Retro</h2>
<p>Sad news for now but Retro is currently on hold. Nothing seems too bad, but I hope this is not the end of retrocaps.</p>

<p>Well today is the day and hopefully something happens. The reason for all the excitement and hope that something will happen is the amount of teasing that has mostly taken place on instagram.</p>

<em>Keycap with Coffee Grounds</em></p>

<p>I‚Äôm fairly certain these keycaps are from WiddleKitty. WiddleKitty popped up not so long back with some impressive first tries. They also made their own <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5gWNhKv.jpg">aluminium master</a></p>

<p>Pictured above is a keycap with coffee grounds in the top which gives it an incredible visual texture.</p>

<p>The other eye-catching cap I saw a long time ago was the Ransom Note keycap:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PCbD5Bz.jpg" alt="WiddleKitty Ransom" /></p>

<p>I would be very interested in getting one of these coffee keycaps. I have tried a similar theme myself but mine turned out more like milky latte‚Äôs.</p>

<h2 id="zorbcaps">ZorbCaps</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UeCK84x.jpg" alt="Carbon Metaljar artisan keycap" />
Zorb has had a lot of sales since I last mentioned them. Pictured above is the Carbon MetalJaw which was featured in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Kce8HaEWJshEMbf5fBAnENQRvqAdRzGt0oTXdwlBd8A/viewform">Carbon Mine Sales.</a></p>

<p>But luckily there is one running right now but this is also a sad sale. As zorb has retired from designing their own keycaps, all future designs will be outsourced to their 9 year old sister. This seems like a solid decision and I can see why this has happened.</p>

<p>Running as of the 1st of April:
It‚Äôs only $15 for a design by one of the hottest designers currently out there.</p>

<h2 id="wob">WoB</h2>
<p>WoB has launched a new site featuring the many designs that were teased on instagram. These are very creative but not entirely to my taste.<br />
One thing I am quite interested in is the rifle keycap puller which was teased a long time ago at the beginning of WoB.</p>

flehrad has finally ascended and bought one of the better keyboards on the market. And with this ascension they quickly began work on making some mod sets. Mod sets are not at all easy and get even trickier when you introduce more colours. I am interested to see where this goes.</p>

Jelly Key has been the talk of the town for what seems like forever. But they are still not widely available. They do look awesome and there isn‚Äôt much else to say. <br />
They will probably be sold through the facebook store which has been in testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.joinhandmade.com/danh-muc-san-pham/keycap-cho-ban-phim-co/">There is also another store but every jelly key is sold out.</a></p>
