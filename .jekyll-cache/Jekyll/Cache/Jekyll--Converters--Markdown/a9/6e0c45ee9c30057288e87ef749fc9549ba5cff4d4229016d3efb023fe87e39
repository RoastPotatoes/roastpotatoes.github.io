If you needed another place to buy this keyboard you now have that opportunity.<br />
The EmojiWorks keyboard is what it sounds like, a keyboard that makes typing emoji that little bit easier. It comes in two versions, base and pro. From what I understand the pro gives you more emoji and there are more printed on the keycaps.</p>

<p>This is a new Cooler Master RGB keyboard. From the Keychatter review it does seem to be a solid RGB keyboard with GUI configurations of the RGB function.</p>

<p>That is a little bit of an exaggeration, but 1upkeyboards is now stocking Gaterons. Itâ€™s always good to have another place to buy switches. The other part of the everything, is the <a href="https://redd.it/4a9wxj">restocking of fleece.</a> So this means a more sleeves.</p>

Jelly Key is a big thing this week and has been featuring prominently all over /r/mk and leaking into gh. Iâ€™m not a huge fan of the galaxy aesthetic but they look really nicely made and I love the hand branding. They are also undeniably eye-catching.</p>

<p>Currently all sold out on the store, but I imagine we will see a lot more of these.</p>
