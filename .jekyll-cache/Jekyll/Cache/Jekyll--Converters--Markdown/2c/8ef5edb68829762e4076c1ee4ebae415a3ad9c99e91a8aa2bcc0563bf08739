<p>You would think this would be exciting, but it’s not. This seems to be a common occurrence when you hear about a new cherry switch. However, I will preface this by saying it might not even be final. This is the rare occurrence in the keyboard world where we have a leak. I almost thought I had dreamt the entire thing up, as the promo images have been deleted.</p>

<p>The idea behind this one is that it is ‘faster’. But everything else about it suggests it is a cherry red.</p>

<p>I can’t say that it is the same switch, but really the differences are entirely negligible. Or are not going to change the game.</p>

RAMA previously announced that the TMX stem was being discontinued, but here it is. And it looks awesome on this BroCaps collaboration. I love stamps in general but this looks incredible. Nothing more on this but I’m excited to see where this goes.</p>

<p>RAMA has also opened up pre-orders for a M10-A t-shirt</p>

The TK78 is a 60% with a numpad on the right. If this goes well, then you could potentially see a left-handed version in the future.</p>

<p>You get the choice of Cherry or Gateron switches and also the option to upgrade to dyesub keycaps.</p>

This is a cnc aluminium milled TKL by 27. I always like this type of groupbuy and these type of designs. It is similar to the TGR Jane and has the general aesthetic of a korean custom.</p>

<p>It is usually hard to go wrong with cnc’d aluminium, (unless you are making a hhkb case) so I am excited to see where this will go.</p>
