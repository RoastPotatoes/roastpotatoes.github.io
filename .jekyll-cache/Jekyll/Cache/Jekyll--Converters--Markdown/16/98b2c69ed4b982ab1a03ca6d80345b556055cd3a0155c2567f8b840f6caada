I"ö<p>Thanks for the continued support. I appreciate all those who continue to read these.</p>

<p>Two things came out of nowhere this past week which were things I thought I‚Äôd never see.</p>

<h2 id="hhkb-professional-bt">HHKB Professional BT</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sZMqAjP.jpg" alt="HHKB Professional BT Profile" />
The first one. I‚Äôm sure this hasn‚Äôt flown under the radar at all, but if you didn‚Äôt know, there is finally an official bluetooth HHKB. Ripster‚Äôs yearly keyboard predictions have always included the hope for a HHKB 3 and I‚Äôm not sure if this counts but, it is close.</p>

<p>Nearly everything seems good with this latest HHKB iteration. The only complaint I can think of is the bluetooth addition has ruined the aesthetic of the keyboard. I have always thought of the HHKB as meticulously designed and a very aesthetically pleasing product. As you can see from the images, the bluetooth addition  culminates in a protruding monstrosity to put the batteries.</p>

<p><strong>Important Information:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>3 Months Battery Life with battery saving on. 1 to 1.5 with battery saving off (allegedly, but probably not a lie)</li>
  <li>2 AA Batteries</li>
  <li>Cross platform support (Mac &amp; Windows but I would imagine you could get it to work on anything linux)</li>
  <li>Any colour if it‚Äôs black</li>
  <li>Available to Pre-order releasing 22nd of April</li>
  <li>¬•29,700 - ¬£192 - $274</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Differences from The Pro 2:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Uses a Micro USB on the keyboard for when bluetooth is not in use</li>
  <li>Additional rubber bumpers beside the feet</li>
  <li>Logo says ‚ÄúHHKB Professional BT‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>Buying one is going to require living in Japan or a proxy.<br />
The other option is <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=71517.0">hasu‚Äôs bt controller</a>. The advantage with this controller is that it is not going to portrude from your HHKB. However, you will get significantly less battery life.</p>

<h2 id="the-textblade">The Textblade</h2>
<p>The second thing I thought I‚Äôd never see. The Textblade has been a keyboard in production for a long time. The short brief is that it is a small keyboard designed to be portable but retain some nice typing feeling. It has been notorious for not being shipped to those who pre-ordered it but at least some people are getting theirs. I am not entirely sure if this is a wide release or they are just being released to testers.</p>

<p><strong>Typing Video:</strong></p>

<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//MVYohnNgweA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>I wouldn‚Äôt quite buy one of these just yet as I really want to know a bit more about how it is to type on.</p>
