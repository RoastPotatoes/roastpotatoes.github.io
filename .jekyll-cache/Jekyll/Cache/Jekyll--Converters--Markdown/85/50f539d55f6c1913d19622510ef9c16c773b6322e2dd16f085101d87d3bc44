<p><em>Speculation from images shown in thread</em></p>

<p>All of these are in slightly eastery pastel colours. I have to say that I really am enjoying these current Brocaps and they look flawless. The colour choices are great and there are no visible imperfections. Brocaps really has become an incredible creator. I‚Äôm really looking forward to the sale. Keep an eye out and I will post a link when it‚Äôs up. It will most likely be on <a href="https://ctrlalt.io/">ctrlalt.io</a>.</p>
