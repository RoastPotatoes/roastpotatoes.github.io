This really was quite surprising, as I had never thought Cooler Master were going to do something like this. A full set of Topre to MX sliders, the same as from the novatouch, were available to purchase. I think they were only available to purchase for a short time as this was testing the waters for possibly putting up more.</p>

<p>Hopefully this does mean they will be available soon.</p>

This was a surprising event that happened out of the blue last night. For the first day only people who posted in radnelac thread get a chance of a keycap, but future days will likely be more open.</p>

<p>More information to follow tomorrow.</p>

Previously mentioned in <a href="https://blog.roastpotatoes.co/weekinkeyboards/2015/09/08/week-in-keykoards-12/#devlin-keycaps">Week in Keyboards #12</a> there is some movement on this project.</p>

<p>To catch you up-to-speed, Devlin is a UK manufacturer of keycaps. They have their own profiles and have been around for a while.</p>

<p>The original plan was for dolch sets and the teaser image still indicates this.</p>

<p>I am certainly interested to see where this goes, and maybe they become a viable UK keycap company.</p>
