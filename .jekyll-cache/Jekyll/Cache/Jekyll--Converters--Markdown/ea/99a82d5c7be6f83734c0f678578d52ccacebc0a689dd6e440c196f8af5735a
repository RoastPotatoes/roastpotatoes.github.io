So this is another thing that indicates that the Wooting Keyboard (The Wooting One) will be worthwhile.</p>

<p>The FlareTech switches were seen a while ago but nothing had really come of them until now.</p>

<p><strong>What use FlareTech switches?</strong><br />
This is a good question and there seem to be two benefits.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Faster Response time. <br />
  I have been critical about switches that try to achieve this in the past however, these have the benefit of using light. Something which I know to be particularly fast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They allow for a modular keyboard. <br />
As they do not have to be soldered to the PCB they can be removed and replaced. This is something that has just been emerging for Cherry MX based keyboards.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

This was mentioned a while back, and there hadn’t been a lot since. I am attracted to this project because it is something that just seems so fantastical. I never thought I’d see the day when there were new modular buckling switches readily (almost) available.</p>

<p>The kickstarter goal is set at $40,000 CAD, and I would say this is more or less the bad news. Price is the biggest issue that projects like these face. Injection moulding and the creation of moulds is not a cheap process. So for this reason the high price is justified. But the high price of course, comes with the inherent issues of having a high priced item.</p>

<p><strong>Backer Goals</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>$20 will get you one exclusive green switch</li>
  <li>$70 will get you 18 switches</li>
  <li>$160 will get you 60</li>
  <li>$225+ 90-110</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see from the prices, it isn’t the cheapest switch you can get. But it is wholly unique.</p>

<p>This is a unique project that I hope to succeed but It’s going to take a lot to get it there.</p>
