I"Ð<p>This is a blog that is primarily about Mechanical Keyboards and various input devices. This occasionally includes trackballs when I can get them.</p>

<p>I try to focus on a variety of different keyboards including the stock and custom variety that is popular in the community.</p>

<p>The other major feature of this blog is Artisan/Artisanal keycaps. I try to cover as much about the Artisan keycaps that I am able to find every month.</p>

<p>If you are interested in Mechanical Keyboards I suggest you visit:</p>
