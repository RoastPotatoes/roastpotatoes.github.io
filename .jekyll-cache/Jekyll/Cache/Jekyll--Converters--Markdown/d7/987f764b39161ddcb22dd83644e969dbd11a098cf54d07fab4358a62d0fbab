<p>This is a community project to create a keyboard that represents as much of the GH community and people as possible. It was started by <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?action=profile;u=51152">Linkshine</a> on Geekhack and now has an impressive list of contributors.<br />
There will be representation of people such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mandolin</li>
  <li>HKP</li>
  <li>Zorb</li>
  <li>Adamski</li>
  <li>booper</li>
  <li>doomcaps</li>
  <li>bro</li>
</ul>

<p>And many others not in this list. It will include a lot of custom keycaps but also things like a custom case and cable. If you want to contribute something to this board, I suggest you contact linkshine on Geekhack.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/13j3SPe.png" alt="THKB The Tiny Hacking Keyboard" />
The Tiny Hacking Keyboard is a custom project that started long ago in 2013. Its goal was to create a HHKB style 40% that is usable. ne0phyte (the creator) is back and working on another PCB two years after the project first started. This is looking to be a more featureful PCB with an integrated atmega32u4 chip unlike the first which housed a teensy.</p>

<p>Hopefully this work continues and we see this keyboard come to fruition. I think the 40% form factor holds a lot of interest and the design options have not been fully explored yet.</p>

<h2 id="logitech-g410">Logitech G410</h2>
<p>Featuring Logitech’s Romer G switches as well as RGB backlighting and a place to put your phone.  I have not tried the Romer G switches but this isn’t making me want to try them. It sports a very peculiar font and a very strange case design.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9g7nMNH.png" alt="Logitech G410 Mechanical Keyboard " /></p>

<p>It is not the most offensive gaming design I have seen, but I just don’t get any interest from this design.
The interesting feature is also the  most gimmicky feature, of course I am referring to the phone holder. Which is more than that, it acts as a second screen. This is done through Logitech’s Arx Control. This allows your phone to display information and act as media controls which are already integrated into the keyboard. I am interested but I just don’t know if I would use that.</p>

Although not mechanical, it is a 40% keyboard with bluetooth and it folds in half. Currently in the kickstarter process, it is at around $12,000 of $30,000 goal. If it was fully programmable, I would be a lot more interested. Simply because it is well and truly portable. But it currently comes in a German layout as well as a standard layout.</p>

<p>It comes with a butterfly like rubberdome rated at 5 million keypresses.</p>

<p>I will also be interested to see whether this ships (assuming it gets funded) before the <a href="https://waytools.com/">textblade.</a> Which has notoriously not shipped for a while now.</p>

<h2 id="textblade-now-available-to-purchase">TextBlade Now Available To Purchase</h2>
<p>The TextBlade can now be purchased through the Waytools website. I’m not sure how much of a good idea it would be to buy one yet, as I am fairly certain no backer has received theirs yet.</p>

<p>There was also a photo of the TextBlade released on their forum.

<p>Despite the delays I am still very interested in this product. From the photos released it does look very nice. Far better than I expected it to look.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ki5vdYx.jpg" alt="The QWERKYwriter typewriter styled keyboard" />
This was a project I was not fully aware of until recently. But it is another keyboard themed like a typewriter. I much prefer this design over the look of a <a href="https://www.datamancer.net/keyboards/keyboards.htm">datamancer</a> which goes for a steam punk aesthetic. The QWERKYwriter looks incredibly clean and nice to type on. It is supposed to ship to those who are kickstarter backers on October 25th.</p>

<p>It is currently available to pre-order for $329 <a href="https://www.qwerkywriter.com/products/pre-order">here</a></p>

<p>I will be shortly putting together my experiences with the UHK prototype. Here I just wanted to showcase its unique ability to be both 60% and split 60%</p>
