## EmojiWorks on amazon.com

If you needed another place to buy this keyboard you now have that opportunity.  
The EmojiWorks keyboard is what it sounds like, a keyboard that makes typing emoji that little bit easier. It comes in two versions, base and pro. From what I understand the pro gives you more emoji and there are more printed on the keycaps.

## Masterkeys Pro L & S Released
This is a new Cooler Master RGB keyboard. From the Keychatter review it does seem to be a solid RGB keyboard with GUI configurations of the RGB function.

## 1upkeyboards Get's Everything
That is a little bit of an exaggeration, but 1upkeyboards is now stocking Gaterons. It's always good to have another place to buy switches. The other part of the everything, is the [restocking of fleece.](https://redd.it/4a9wxj) So this means a more sleeves.

## Jelly Key
![Jelly Key](http://i.imgur.com/1MoLtuP.jpg)
Jelly Key is a big thing this week and has been featuring prominently all over /r/mk and leaking into gh. I'm not a huge fan of the galaxy aesthetic but they look really nicely made and I love the hand branding. They are also undeniably eye-catching.

Currently all sold out on the store, but I imagine we will see a lot more of these.

## JTK Sophmore 
CtrlAlt has a lot more of JTK goodness to offer my favourite being the valentine set.

There is a lot of nice set's on offer so have a look if you are interested in a new keyset.
