Not a huge amount of much this week.

## Backlit POK3R on Massdrop
For those who want a backlit 60% this is a good option. The standard POK3R has been around for a while and has been quite well received. In general this is thought of as quite a nice stock 60%.

## Possible New Vortex Board
There isn't a lot too this as you never know if this will make it into production. This is a 40% ish prototype from Vortex.

## New F62 and F77 Prototypes Slightly Delayed
This is not a major setback or anything. But at this stage everyone is patiently waiting for the full prototype so delays like this can be the most frustrating. Prototypes could be still a week or so away.

## RoastPotatoes Fancy New Domain
It's happening. [blog.roastpotatoes.co](https://blog.roastpotatoes.co/) All previous links should still work. Potentially this opens up the possibility of store.roastpotatoes.co

I also managed to miss my deadline of Friday newsletter. It will happen this week.

## Other RoastPotatoes

My posters were going excellent up until today when I really looked at them. They are OK, but maybe not where I had quite hoped the quality would be. Reprint is coming on Thursday so they are slightly delayed. I will see what happens from there.

Designs for 4704 keyboards have moved along quite a bit and I am quite interested to see what I will settle with. I have designs wish legends and without and the relegendeble keycaps.
