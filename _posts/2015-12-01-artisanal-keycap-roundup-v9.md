## ImpendingxDoom

*Excellent photo & excellent keycaps.*

To me these were the most eye catching keycaps I saw this month. These are cherry profile blanks in quite incredible colours. The sale is currently over but I imagine these won't be the last to make it into production. A stellar example of what makes artisan keycaps appealing.

## KatzenKinder
![Katzenkinder rGB Sale](https://i.imgur.com/YuMEIpb.jpg)
KatzenKinder is mildly back and had a RGB sale. I mentioned it a week or so ago when it happened and it had some very nice looking keycaps. This sale emphasised the simpler colours and the improvement that can be seen Katzen's casting.

I really do admire KatzenKinder and appreciate their work.

## GirlDC
![](https://i.imgur.com/Uh4azTP.jpg)
GirlDC has been maintaining the increased activity and shown new colours and new keycaps. It doesn't look like these are available just yet. But I would keep an eye out on [girldc.com](http://www.girldc.com/%EC%83%81%ED%92%88-%EC%B9%B4%ED%85%8C%EA%B3%A0%EB%A6%AC/keycaps/)

Also, watch [/u/girldc](https://www.reddit.com/user/girldc) for more photos and updates.

## ZorbCaps
Zorb is doing something quite interesting with a giveaway raffle type thing, but I'm not sure I entirely sure what is going on. As I understand it there are 25 entrants and 25 days of free keycaps randomly given away to those who managed to get in.

## HiddenPower
I was quite surprised to see a new Darth Vader cap this soon, but this is modelled after the Force Awakens Vader helmet seen in the trailers.

## XX7
![XX7 MEGATRQN](http://i.imgur.com/ygieXZo.jpg)
XX7 was on massdrop with the MEGATRQN design. It was available in Topre and MX with 3 colour schemes.

If you missed out, then you can still purchase one in [xx7's store.](http://xx7keycaps.bigcartel.com/product/megatrqn)

## KeyKollectiv
![KeyKollectiv Alien Skull](https://i.imgur.com/OQcRGva.jpg)
KeyKollectiv has been teasing the new design which is some sort of alien skull thing, but its name is Furt. I'm not sure what it is but it seems to be technically impressive. Having translucent surrounding the sculpt is probably not an easy process.

## Carbonman24
As a new maker this super meat boy keycap looks remarkably nice. It seems to be shaped quite well and the colour is strong and it does indeed look like super meat boy.

## Pyrolovesmoney

Pyrolovesmoney is a new maker who has started painting 3d printed keycaps. I do think there is something that can be added to some keycaps through a bit of paint. I am particularly fond of what Bosk has done with some of mine.

![hydro dipped keycap](https://i.imgur.com/vwX39NS.jpg)
The name you have to copy and paste has been experimenting with hydro dipped keycaps. The main concert here is will they last under even a small amount of duress. I do like some of these off the wall colour combinations.

## Monty20python
Monty20python is known for creating the most unwieldy keycap ever is back with bold designs. It's nice to see the tenacity in their continued work.

## Gloyz

Gloyz has quickly appeared and maintained their detailed high quality casts. These are photos from the upcoming Christmas sales which I'm sure will be along sometime in December. My favourite out of those would be the holly. It makes use of their superior sculpting ability but in a simpler design.

## Brocaps
A small update from Bro was posted in the official sales thread on geekhack. [Read the full thing here.](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=59295.msg1950686#msg1950686)

The main points

>
> 3 All future sales will not require a post count. 
> 
> 
> 4 There will be some Bro-related products for purchase in the CTRL ALT store soon (could be swag, caps, etc). 
> 
> 
> 5 MX Gamer keys are undergoing a re-design and will be released soon-ish.
> 
> 
> 6 Your favorite keycap design will be coming back in its new form.

I was hoping the favourite design was the Brobot V3 but I have no idea.

## Krytone
A Krap sale is slated for this [Saturday the 5th](http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/christmas?iso=20151205T22&p0=122&msg=Topre+KRAP+Sale%21&font=cursive&csz=1&swk=1) it is a Topre sale so will probably include Topre caps. Krytone has been teasing some very nice new skulls and cluster sets so this could be very interesting.

## Official Closure of Bingecap
This is a fairwell to the front of everything Binge as Bingecaps. After the year is up Bingecaps is officially Hunger Work Studio. This isn't bad or anything but just an evolution of what binge has created. I imagine it will be quite interesting.

## RoastPotatoes 
![New RoastPotatoes Keycap](http://i.imgur.com/f3oLJrR.jpg)
I have been mostly making posters this month. But I did make some keycaps at some point. I have made new moulds for Heart Hugs as that is one of my favourite keycaps. The Heart Hug should be reappearing in new MX, Topre, and buckling springs.

RGB is not dead, but on hiatus until I can make them again.
