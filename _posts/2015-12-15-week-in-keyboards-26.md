## 60% Acrylic Case 
![Early render of case](https://i.imgur.com/VdlmJ5W.jpg)
*Early Render*

I thought this was quite a nice project as the custom cases are becoming harder to come by than the PCB's. Especially one as competitively priced as this one. The current estimation is Â£35 for this acrylic 60% case. Other options are being explored and aluminium could be a possibility but at a higher price.

This project was started by xondat on geekhack.

The sale is not yet live so no link to the form. Looks to include some very nice colours.

## WhiteFox Probably a Success
I say probably, but there is really no question about it. The first batch of 1000 sold in no time, now the maximum number has been extended to 2000. If you missed out on the first 1000, then you are in luck.

For those not in the know, the WhiteFox is a 65% keyboard created by matt3o.

## Matt3o Topre Keyset

Although this was a very interesting idea, it seems that it is not too popular. Currently the Skull Squadron colour way is on Massdrop but is shy of the 200 $139 price point. With 1 day to go, it does not look like this will be a huge success.  
Although this is a real shame it seems that the strict constraints of the project, the price and the MOQ have just put people off. Hopefully this is not the end of the Topre keyset resurgence. A lot of work went into this set so it's a shame to see it flounder like it is.

## XC Cable Debut

A new cable has been put up on the [tgr.my](https://tgr.my/store/) store. These seem a little different to the traditional braided cable as the individual wires are wrapped and braided.   
This debut colour comes in a number of patterns.

## New KeyboardCo Website
![keyboardco website december 2015](https://i.imgur.com/50onfJW.png)
For those in the UK the KeyboardCo is a fairly good source of mechanical keyboards. For a long time the website had a very distinctive design, that might not have been the most aesthetically pleasing. It now looks quite nice, but if you are feeling nostalgic for the old look it is still available at the click of a button.
