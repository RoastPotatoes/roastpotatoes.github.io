## 3D Modelling and Rendering Services
You may have seen some 3d renders appearing for some recent GB's. Such as [Troubled minds](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=75345.0)
[![Troubled minds keyset render](https://i.imgur.com/y6ra6SRl.jpg)](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=75345.0)
or [Alpine Winter](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=75515.0)
[![Alpine winter alps keysest](https://i.imgur.com/qlygHnI.jpg)](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=75515.0)

These renders are done by a community member thesiscamper who is now offering these type or renderings as a service. 

The prices are:

* $50 for the first render
* $10 for each additional render/image

Although the renders are very impressive and do look great it would add another cost to a GB. So I don't see a problem with this pricing as there must be a considerable amount of work going into make them look like this, but it will be up to the individual if they want to get these nice renders for their GB.

## UK Meetup
For those of you in the UK who want to attend a geekhack meetup the current plan is the 24th in Brighton. I have not been to one before and I don't think there has been a great many in the UK. So this may be an interesting opportunity.

* [More Information](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=75674.0)

## Nashville Meetup 10/20
I thought I should also give this a mention as not everyone lives in the UK. But everyone does also not live in Nashville. So this may or may not be relevant to you.

## The Monarch Alps 60% With Left Numpad
![The Monarch Alps keyboard groupbuy m](https://i.imgur.com/SJWvcSbh.jpg)
This is not only a GB for a new alps keyboard, but it also features a semi unusual layout. It is a 60% with the addition of the numpad on the left side as opposed to its usual position on the right. The idea behind this is that you are able to have your mouse slightly closer on the right without sacrificing the functionality of the numpad.

This is a full keyboard kit minus the keycaps. For the current price of $250 you will get:

* Top Plate
* Bottom Plate
* Center Spacer
* PCB
* 12 Machine Screws
* Rubber Feet (4 small and 4 large hemispherical)

The idea is you can get the keycaps and stabilisers from an Apple Extended II to easily cover this keyboard.

## Alpine Winters Keyset
![Alpine Winters Keyset Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/ncMBeAFh.png)
Continuing with the Alps theme this keyset is worth a mention. I believe this is the first custom Alps keyset that is community designed and It has been in planning for a long time. Whether we see more alps sets like this in the future, is also unknown. So if you are a fan of alps and you like a nice keyset this is a good opportunity.

Comparisons have been made with the Triumph Adler keyset and I can see some similarity in the colours. But I really think this is a nice combination.

Orders close on October the 24th

## PMK is Back in Some Form
The relaunch brings support for mobile devices and everything looks a little better. It does not seem to be without issues as there have been plenty of issues with links going nowhere.

There are a couple of sets available such as deep space and eve. But both of these are available in limited quantities and limited kits. Hopefully this website continues to improve.

## Unicomp Website Updated
It has been due for an update for a while and it is finally here. With cosmetic changes and responsive design, this doesn't bring any new products, but maybe this change was made in preparation for the imminent release of the Unicomp SSK (most definitely conjecture).

## New Renders of the K-Type
![The K-type](https://i.imgur.com/3bchOJo.jpg)
The K-Type is the new tenkeyless made by the Input Club who previously made the Infinity ErgoDox as well as the Infinity. I did an announcement post for it [here]({{ site.base-url }}/2015/08/07/the-k-type-by-input-club/) if you want more information.

This is coming from the Vortex Facebook page.

Coming from Vortex this will likely be a solid RGB 60%.

## Artisan Sales
I thought these were worth a mention as these are time sensitive.

### Bingecap Now HungerWorkStudio
Binge who is transitioning into creating HungerWorkStudio still has the hyperfuse raffle available. This is a good opportunity to get a bingecap as well as some nice stickers.

### HotKeysProject October Sale
![Halloween Orange Raven MX HKP Artisan Keycap](https://i.imgur.com/4sks0uK.jpg)
This sale is only featuring MX keycaps in a small variety of colours. My current favourite is the Halloween edition Raven. All the orange caps look incredibly vibrant and I will certainly consider either a Trooper or a Raven

## Green Tea is Back
![Green Tea Green and Grey Keyset](https://i.imgur.com/Vgsp4Bf.png)
I haven't seen too much interest in this yet, which I though strange because of how popular the previous set seems to be in the aftermarket. Green Tea Lite is the new iteration. I am guessing that although it is named lite it is in fact lighter. I really like this set but much prefer the previous look. It is currently in the interest check stage so a little open to suggestion. I believe the render above is SA profile whilst the previous iteration was DCS.

## Planck Sets Available on PMK

The set's includes:

Planck base set:

*  32 1u
