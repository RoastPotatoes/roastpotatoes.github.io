## Zealios Groupbuy Started
This is an interesting GB as it is the first custom switch the community has seen. It comes in both tactile and linear variants with the option of 62g, 65g and 67g variants. It is being held at [zealpc.net](https://zealpc.net/collections/group-buy-pre-orders). Each order also allows you to be in an exclusive bingecap raffle.

## Keychatter Store 
Preparations have begun for the opening of the keychatter store.

> Artisan keycaps, custom cables, custom cases, and keyboard parts coming soon!

I'm not sure what artisans and products will be offered. But this is a nice direction for the store to go. I belive livingspeedbump will do something good with it.

So September for Australia and I believe it is already shipping in Taiwan. 

There also seems to be something interesting going on regards to the double layer PCB.

This does look a bit like innovation. But I can't quite tell from the photos what is actually going on.

## Sentrantpc
The universal plate featured last week is now live on massdrop. This is not the same as the JDcarpe designed LeandreN one. But was designed with fewer options in order for it to be cheaper, therefore a viable option for many. It also comes with a nice selection of colours for anodizing.

It seems sentrantpc is gearing up for something with an interest check for custom spring weights. If you are interested in getting your perfect switch weight, I suggest you fill out the interest form.

## LeandreN

The PCB and Plate GB is now over and in the production/invoicing stage. As this is an interesting GB, I think it worth covering. PayPal issues have been resolved. Everyone has been invoiced and around 80% already paid. Plates are done and are now ready for anodizing. This means you can expect them in 2 weeks ish.

* [More Info](https://leandren.blogspot.no/p/leandren.html)

That previous link is to LeandreN's blog which hast just started up. I imagine it will be a good place for more information on what's happening.

## Blahlicus
With a manufacturing delay on the Diverge II's PCB everything is now on track. Shipping should have started today.

## New Ortholinear Keyboard
![](https://i.imgur.com/LjG4xAr.jpg)
This was announced on the latest episode of Board Makers. It is a planck with an additional row on top, or bottom depending how you look at it.

This is also a good time to mention Board Makers the premier keyboard podcast. Episode 10 came out today.

## Keycaps

### Binge Hoards Hyperfuse
Binge bought 100 additional sets of GMK hyperfuse which ran on Ctrlalt earlier in the year. They will soon be sold on binge's website [bingecap.com](https://bingecap.com)

### Gen.s
[![](https://i.imgur.com/PNEn2HU.jpg)](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=74200.0)
A groupbuy has started for Gen.s's keycaps pictured [here](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=74200.0) Orders are ending 1st of September so I though it worth mentioning before it had gone.  
They all look of great quality, but they are quite pricey.
Prices:

* Gem Caps $20
* Daft Punk $50
* Shipping $6-13 (CONUS to International)
