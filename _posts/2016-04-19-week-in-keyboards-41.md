## New Cherry Switch Leaked
You would think this would be exciting, but it's not. This seems to be a common occurrence when you hear about a new cherry switch. However, I will preface this by saying it might not even be final. This is the rare occurrence in the keyboard world where we have a leak. I almost thought I had dreamt the entire thing up, as the promo images have been deleted.

The idea behind this one is that it is 'faster'. But everything else about it suggests it is a cherry red.

I can't say that it is the same switch, but really the differences are entirely negligible. Or are not going to change the game.

## LUSTRO

Another 60% project with a unique looking case. The above photo is of the production sample. Not much to go on but these are the likely kits:

* Minimal kit: side pairs + body.
* Basic kit: minimal kit + carbon fiber plate.
* Full kit: basic kit + pcb (bface) + switches + leds for who don't wait.

Price TBC

## RAMA x Bro

RAMA previously announced that the TMX stem was being discontinued, but here it is. And it looks awesome on this BroCaps collaboration. I love stamps in general but this looks incredible. Nothing more on this but I'm excited to see where this goes.

RAMA has also opened up pre-orders for a M10-A t-shirt

## TK78 Now on Massdrop

The TK78 is a 60% with a numpad on the right. If this goes well, then you could potentially see a left-handed version in the future.

You get the choice of Cherry or Gateron switches and also the option to upgrade to dyesub keycaps.

This is just another place you can get zealios. Both 78g and 65g tactile versions are available.

## Mech27 by 27 (formally xx7)
![Mech27 keyboard](https://i.imgur.com/pF0kqAx.png)
This is a cnc aluminium milled TKL by 27. I always like this type of groupbuy and these type of designs. It is similar to the TGR Jane and has the general aesthetic of a korean custom.

It is usually hard to go wrong with cnc'd aluminium, (unless you are making a hhkb case) so I am excited to see where this will go.
