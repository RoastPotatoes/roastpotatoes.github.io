## Cooler Master Topre to MX Sliders
![](http://i.imgur.com/wYInG0K.jpg)
This really was quite surprising, as I had never thought Cooler Master were going to do something like this. A full set of Topre to MX sliders, the same as from the novatouch, were available to purchase. I think they were only available to purchase for a short time as this was testing the waters for possibly putting up more.

Hopefully this does mean they will be available soon.

## Clack is Once Again Back
[![](http://i.imgur.com/ABRQqdk.png)](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=77786.msg2077252#msg2077252)
This was a surprising event that happened out of the blue last night. For the first day only people who posted in radnelac thread get a chance of a keycap, but future days will likely be more open. 

More information to follow tomorrow.

## UKKeycaps & Devlin
![](http://i.imgur.com/mtCfFkq.jpg)
Previously mentioned in [Week in Keyboards #12](http://blog.roastpotatoes.co/weekinkeyboards/2015/09/08/week-in-keykoards-12/#devlin-keycaps) there is some movement on this project.

To catch you up-to-speed, Devlin is a UK manufacturer of keycaps. They have their own profiles and have been around for a while.

The original plan was for dolch sets and the teaser image still indicates this.

I am certainly interested to see where this goes, and maybe they become a viable UK keycap company.
