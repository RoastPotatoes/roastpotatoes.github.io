## New Cherry White Switch
This is probably the biggest news but also not particularly interesting or at all what people wanted. I am not excited by this, but I'm sure there are some people who must find this new switch to be exactly what they wanted. But I would think this to be a rather small group.

These are RGB switches with 55cN weight.

## New Split 40% by Blahlicus

![Split Terminus Mini](https://i.imgur.com/aL98o52.jpg)

This is another show of quiet innovation from blahlicus that I like. Whoever they are, they always seem to be making an interesting keyboard.

It's a split version of the terminus Mini which can be seen [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/2w4fw7/the_terminus_mini_is_finally_completed_a_40_diy/)

More information is to be released as it happens. But currently it looks like it joins similar to the ergodox with a trrs cable in between. A wireless version could be possible in the future, but this is the first iteration.

## Bluetooth Planck
With the absence of board makers last week Jack was working on the bluetooth planck. This allows you to somewhat easily add bluetooth functionality to your planck PCB.

## SentrantPC now Sentraq and New Keyboards to Follow
### Updates on TK78 60% with Numpad
A revision of the PCB has been ordered for testing and they are hoping for a Christmas or new years ship date. This is an unusual design of a 60% with a numpad. I think this is something that there is a market for and I only hope this fills peoples needs.

### Unnamed 60%
The update also came with the announcement of a 60% keyboard kit that is launching on massdrop in time for Christmas. If it is affordably priced I can see this as a nice 60% for people to build. But currently there does not seem to be a lack of 60%'s.
