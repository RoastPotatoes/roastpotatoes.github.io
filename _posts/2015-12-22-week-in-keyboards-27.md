## Topre Keyset Given Extra Life
I was awake one night and thinking about keycaps when I realised this should have finished by now. That is the case however it was extended by a week. What's also notable is the further behind the scenes negotiations that could potentially make this more enticing. There are no changes yet, but I do feel hope for this project.

## Possible Movement for Uniqey

I saw this posted on reddit but nothing was sent out on the official newsletter or updated on the gmk website. From what I understand these are just concept images for advertising purposes. Despite that, they do look quite nice. I'm not too sure about some of those colour combinations but the blue and white is excellent by itself.

I'm assuming these were created by Grau Wild. Find more of these concept images on their website.

## Mechanical Keyboards For Noobs
This was a live event by skiwithpete a little bit of introductory things and many keycaps. This is a nice video if you are looking for keyboard stuff to watch.

## POK3R RGB

This is again nothing new. The announcement was a photo of a RGB POK3R with no release date confirmed.

Nonetheless, they are closer than they previously were.

## GMK SNES on MD
[![GMK SNES Keyset](https://i.imgur.com/RZlgKJ8.jpg)](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/gmk-snes-keycap-set?mode=guest_open)

This is the GMK SNES themed keyset (shock!) now on Massdrop. I have to say that for me this is one of my favourite themed keycap sets. It captures the colours and also looks very nice in the mockups.

With the base set at $119.99 and including 146 keycaps you are getting a nice amount of keycaps with a nice amount of layout support. The additional 'Super FX Chip Pack' you get some darker modifiers and a colourful WASD.

To get this to happen the MOQ is set for 500 Units

## SEALWoodworking on Massdrop
SEALWoodworking is inanis on gh. These are 60% cases handmade out of wood. For this drop you are given the choice of Black Walnut, Purpleheart and Tigerwood. Although I have not had one of these cases, from my interaction with inanis they are a very nice person.   
If you are looking for a wooden 60% case this would be a good community person to support.

## New F62 and F77 Prototype Photos

This has been long awaited and these photos are proof that this is an excellent project. Although these won't be here for christmas the project has been moving rapidly.  

Be sure to look at the thread to see all the photos as it is incredible to see these IBM style cases made again. Also be aware that these photos are possibly not too accurate to the colours you will see with your eyes.
