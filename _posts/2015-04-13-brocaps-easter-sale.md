A new Brocaps sale has been announced for possibly the 13th or 14th. Brocaps said the sale will last "about 24 hours"[<sup>1</sup>](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=70928.msg1715075#msg1715075). This is for the previously teased easter keycaps.   

Featuring:

* Brobots V2
* Bronads
* Topre Gamer Set's 

*Speculation from images shown in thread*

All of these are in slightly eastery pastel colours. I have to say that I really am enjoying these current Brocaps and they look flawless. The colour choices are great and there are no visible imperfections. Brocaps really has become an incredible creator. I'm really looking forward to the sale. Keep an eye out and I will post a link when it's up. It will most likely be on [ctrlalt.io](https://ctrlalt.io/).
