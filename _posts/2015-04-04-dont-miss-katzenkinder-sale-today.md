The sale is taking place sometime today. It should be taking place somewhere on geekhack. At the moment it looks like it will be taking the form of a 24 hour raffle similar to how brocaps orchestrates his sales.  
Follow this [thread](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=64501.0) for additional information.

I will update with a link to the sale as it happens.

**Update**  
It's almost happening. Main [thread](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=64501.0) has been updated with images of the caps included in the sale.
Google doc for orders has been added.
